I did not try to download the CS109 2015 videos using this [script](https://github.com/christopher-beckham/cs109-dl-videos) because it requires the `rtmpdump` download which I find somewhat overkill for one time use. But of course you can give it a try.<br><br>\n",

Each video presentation as listed in [Class Material](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html) has two mp4 files:\n",
    "* **Presenter**. This video is focused on the lecturer and has, of course, audio.\n",
    "* **Presentation**. This video is the presentation, has no sound and in most cases can also be viewed in the slides on GitHub. However this presentation keeps pace with the presenter video.<br>\n",
