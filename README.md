5 years old, but still in the 2020 list of [Top 7 Online Data Science Courses](https://www.learndatasci.com/best-data-science-online-courses/):<br><br>
"With a great mix of theory and application, this course from Harvard is one of the best for getting started as a beginner. It’s not on an interactive platform, like ***Coursera*** or ***edX***, and doesn’t offer any sort of certification, but it’s definitely worth your time and it’s totally free.

Curriculum:

    Web Scraping, Regular Expressions, Data Reshaping, Data Cleanup, Pandas
    Exploratory Data Analysis
    Pandas, SQL and the Grammar of Data
    Statistical Models
    Storytelling and Effective Communication
    Bias and Regression
    Classification, kNN, Cross Validation, Dimensionality Reduction, PCA, MDS
    SVM, Evaluation, Decision Trees and Random Forests, Ensemble Methods, Best Practices
    Recommendations, MapReduce, Spark
    Bayes Theorem, Bayesian Methods, Text Data
    Clustering
    Effective Presentations
    Experimental Design
    Deep Networks
    Building Data Science

Python is used in this course, and there’s many lectures going through the intricacies of the various data science libraries to work through real-world, interesting problems. This is one of the only data science courses around that actually touches on every part of the data science process."

# Intro CS109-2015

## Lectures

The Lecture slides up to Lecture 1 are in this repository. Just click on the Lectures Folder.

## Lab 1

https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1

The git lab can be read [here](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/Lab1-git.ipynb).

## HW 0

You can read it [here](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/hw0.ipynb).

The repository is at:

https://github.com/cs109-students/2015hw

Switch to branch hw0.

You will not be able to access the above link if you have not been added to the cs109-students github organization. For this to happen, you must have submitted the survey, and it will take a bit of time for us to get to your github id after that.

For this reason, we have included HW0 in the lab link above.

At that point, homework repositories will be created for you.

## Initial Workflow

- read hw 0, and do the survey and installations
- then read the git lab in lab 1 linked from within.
- read the git flows at the end of both these documents
- now clone the lab repository. (workflow is in the README and at the end of hw 0)
- Run the hw0.ipynb file, installing additional python libraries
- run all the lab notebooks, including the git notebook, to get familiar with python, pandas and git

By this point you should have a cs109-students/githubuserid-2015hw repository, - which you should clone, and carry out the homework flow on. (homework flow is in the README for https://github.com/cs109-students/2015hw and at the end of hw0.ipynb (https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/hw0.ipynb) and (https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/Lab1-git.ipynb).

```python

```
