# 2015lab11
January 2021: last Lab in this CS109-2015 class. Covers the **Elastic Net** regression analysis method that takes benefits from both LASSO and Ridge Regression. Interesting business case **Chicago Food Inspection Forecasting** also regarding the presentation using GitHub Pages and the public response to it. The way I understand it: instead of a rigid recurring event (schedule) for the inspectors to check food establishments on violations, this solution predicts restaurants likely to have critical violations so they can be inspected earlier.<br>Quite laborious to get this thing working more than 5 years after the actual lab section. Cool to finally see R code executed in a Python notebook thanks to package `rpy2`.
